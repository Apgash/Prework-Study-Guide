# Prework-Study-Guide
A study guide for course pre-work.
# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## This webpage is a study guide and provides notes for the following HTML, JavaScript, Github, and CSS. My motivation for this project was to help organize and to help me more efficiently study what I need to learn for coding botcamp. It helps organize my notes and makes them more accesible to read. This project also has code built in to help me choose what to study via randomizer. I learned a lot while building this project, like what different jobs languages have to a project and how to use Github.

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- What was your motivation?
